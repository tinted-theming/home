# ANSI8 Styling Guidelines

**Version 0.1.0** The latest version of this spec can be obtained from
[tinted-theming/specs/ansi8/styling](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home/blob/main/specs/ansi8/styling.md)

**Note**: This spec is currently unstable due to development.

ANSI8 aims to make it very simple to style terminal based applications, but can
be heavily expanded to style complex GUI applications. ANSI8 simplifies the
process of creating a color scheme by asking the user to only specify the 8
basic ANSI colors. The builder will then generate all additional colors,
including bright variants, "Black" to "White" gradients, and dim variants.

In this model, the core 8 ANSI colors represent a palette, and the builder
handles the generation of other necessary colors. The design follows a basic
rule where:

- `palette.<black|red|green|yellow|blue|magenta|cyan|white>` are the 8 user-defined colors.
- Bright and Dim variants of each color are automatically generated.
- `gray` and `brown` colors are automatically generated.

ANSI8 allows scheme authors to style specific theme properties. This is done by
setting override properties and adds a lot of optional flexibility.

## Scheme properties

### System (required)

Must contain the property value `ansi8`.

### Variant (required)

Currently only `dark` and `light` are supported variants. The builder will
adjust theme backgrounds and foregrounds based on the `dark` and `light` values
here.

### Name (required)

The name of the scheme.

### Author (optional)

Who authored the scheme?

## Required Colors

| Color Name                                                             | ANSI Color | Description                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| palette.black (![#](https://placehold.co/25/282c34/000000?text=%2B))   | 0          | Default background color (dark theme) |
| palette.red (![#](https://placehold.co/25/e06c75/000000?text=%2B))     | 1          | error messages                        |
| palette.green (![#](https://placehold.co/25/98c379/000000?text=%2B))   | 2          | Used for strings, success messages    |
| palette.yellow (![#](https://placehold.co/25/e5c07b/000000?text=%2B))  | 3          | Used for constants, warnings          |
| palette.blue (![#](https://placehold.co/25/61afef/000000?text=%2B))    | 4          | Used for functions, method names      |
| palette.magenta (![#](https://placehold.co/25/c678dd/000000?text=%2B)) | 5          | Used for keywords, selectors          |
| palette.cyan (![#](https://placehold.co/25/56b6c2/000000?text=%2B))    | 6          | Used for support, regex patterns      |
| palette.white (![#](https://placehold.co/25/be5046/000000?text=%2B))   | 7          | Used for text and light backgrounds   |

### Sample TOML Scheme

Here's what the ANSI8 specification would look like in TOML format:

```toml
system = "ansi8"
name = "Ayu"
author = "User <user@example.com>"
variant = "dark"

[palette]
black   = "#131721"
red     = "#f07178"
green   = "#b8cc52"
yellow  = "#ffb454"
blue    = "#59c2ff"
magenta = "#d2a6ff"
cyan    = "#95e6cb"
white   = "#e6e1cf"
```

**Dev Notes**: Thoughts here could be to give the builder access to a dark and
light variant of a theme to allow it to solve things like this:

## Optional Colors

Code templates will largely pull colors from the variables in the table below.
These variables are set by automatically using the `<color>_<variant>` values
generated by the builder, but can be modified directly by the scheme author
using the `override` properties.

**Note**: Have a look at `specs/ansi8/builder.md` for more information about
`<color>_<variant>` values.

| Override Property                   | Default Color   | Description |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| override.comment                    | gray_dim        | Color used for comments in the code, usually for non-executable text providing context or explanation. |
| override.string.quoted              | green_default   | Color used for quoted strings, such as text enclosed in double or single quotes. |
| override.string.regexp              | cyan_default    | Color for regular expressions, which are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. |
| override.constant.language.boolean  | yellow_bright   | Color used for boolean constants like `true` or `false` in code. |
| override.character.entity           | red_default     | Color used for special character entities, like `&amp;` or `&lt;` in HTML. |
