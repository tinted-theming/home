# Tinted Theming Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Tinted Theming is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive community where everyone feels respected and valued. We expect all community members, including contributors, maintainers, and users, to adhere to this Code of Conduct.

## Inclusivity and Respect

We value diversity and believe that a wide range of perspectives and experiences enriches our community. We are committed to creating an environment free from discrimination, harassment, and disrespectful behavior.

## Language and Communication

We strive for a community where everyone communicates with respect and empathy. Language has power, and we must use it responsibly.

### Understanding Slurs and Offensive Language

It's important to be aware that certain words, even those that might seem commonplace, can be harmful. This includes slurs or derogatory language directed at any disadvanged and underrepresented group, whether based on race, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexual orientation, or other characteristics. Such language:

- Contributes to a culture of exclusion.
- Creates an unwelcoming environment for affected individuals and groups.
- Contradicts our values of respect and inclusivity.

## Expected Behavior

We expect all members of the Tinted Theming community to:

1. Assume positive intentions in their interactions with others. Approach conversations and actions with the belief that community members mean well and are acting in good faith.
1. Be respectful and considerate of others, regardless of their background, identity, or beliefs.
1. Use inclusive language and avoid derogatory or offensive comments. This includes refraining from any slurs or derogatory language. If you're unsure whether a word might be offensive, we encourage erring on the side of caution and choosing more neutral terms.
1. Listen actively and be open to different viewpoints and ideas.
1. Provide constructive feedback and criticism in a respectful manner.
1. Be patient and supportive, especially with newcomers.
1. Respect and protect the privacy of others.
1. Respect others' pronouns and gender identities. We also encourage people to avoid making assumptions about anyone's pronouns and to use gender-neutral pronouns (they/them) when pronouns are unknown.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

1. Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, or any other protected characteristic.
1. Offensive, derogatory, or hurtful comments, jokes, or slurs.
1. Personal attacks, trolling, or bullying.
1. Posting or sharing inappropriate or offensive content.
1. Unsolicited sexual advances or attention.
1. Invasion of personal privacy, including sharing personal information without consent.
1. Disruptive or aggressive behavior in community spaces.
1. Violation of any applicable laws or regulations.

## Reporting and Enforcement

### Process

When reporting a violation, include a detailed account of the incident with relevant information such as the date, time, and nature of the violation. All reports will be treated with strict confidentiality. Our team will review and investigate each report and respond within a few days. Depending on the severity of the violation, actions may include warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans from the community.

## Be Mindful
